## Installation Guide
Setting up Sonus is designed to be as simple as possible.
1. Download the latest release of Sonus, based on your server version, from the release section.
2. Place the downloaded .jar file into your serverâ€™s `/plugins` folder.
3. Restart your server. This will generate the default configuration files in the `plugins/Sonus/` folder.


## Update Guide
For most updates that include bug fixes and small feature additions, you do not need to reset your configuration files.
1. Stop your server.
2. Delete the old `Sonus-x.x.x.jar` file from your `/plugins` folder.
3. Place the new, downloaded .jar file into your `/plugins` folder and remove the old one.
4. Start your server.

> [!WARNING]
> Always check the changelog before updating. It will state if a configuration reset is necessary. If a reset is recommended, back up your existing `plugins/Sonus` folder and delete the necessary configuration files.

## Statistics
![STATS](https://bstats.org/signatures/bukkit/Sonus.svg)

To guide future development and improvements, this plugin utilises bStats to gather anonymous statistics on its usage. This helps me track the total server count, assess version compatibility needs, and see which features are most valued by the community.

You can view all of this information openly on the public dashboard: https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Sonus

If you prefer to disable bStats, you can manage this setting for your entire server within the plugins/bStats/config.yml configuration file.
