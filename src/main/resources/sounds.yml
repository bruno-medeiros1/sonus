# This file allows you to define custom sound profiles and assign them to the
# regions you create in-game. To add custom sounds check out this guide

#        (e.g., "minecraft:ambient.cave") or a custom sound from a resource pack.
#
# source: (Optional) The sound category the sound will be played in. This allows
#         players to control the volume in their client settings.
#         Valid options: MASTER, MUSIC, RECORD, WEATHER, BLOCK, HOSTILE,
#         NEUTRAL, PLAYER, AMBIENT, VOICE.
#         Default: AMBIENT

#         Default: 1.0
#
# pitch: (Optional) The pitch of the sound, from 0.5 (low) to 2.0 (high).
#         Default: 1.0
#
# loop: (Optional) Set to true if you want the sound to repeat.
#         Default: false
#
# loop-time: (Optional) If loop is true, this is the delay in seconds
#         before the sound plays again.
